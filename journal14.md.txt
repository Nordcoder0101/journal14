Journal 14

I have been battling a big all week and it finally caught up to me.  Our group is really on pont however, and we all 
have our responsibilites divided.  I think with the level of expertise we have in our group, that we should get through 
this pretty easily.  I spent the morning reviewing much of the material, and am getting more comfortale every day.
This project shold be pretty fun, I love board games, and it's fun to create something that mirrors my interests.
